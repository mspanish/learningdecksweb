Thanks for stopping by our new site. This website is an attempt to put together a wide variety of Flash based educational and creative apps I've worked on since about 1999. We've used these materials in my commercial products such as Musical Spanish, the Insta Spanish E-learning System, and our 20+ apps throughout the app stores such as Learn to Read Kids, Dress the Animals, InstaSpanish, and more.

About Me: I am a homeschool mom with 3 children from Anchorage, Alaska. My vivacious 6 year old Julia is homeschooling for 1st grade, and this blog will be used to talk about her experiences, as well as do product reviews of things we've discovered are super awesome!

We hope you enjoy our website, and plan to add new things as often as we can.
