I've added 2 more old apps online which may be useful for students struggling with Spanish verb tenses: Learn Spanish Verbs Fast! Audio eBook, and the Spanish Verb Visualizer. These apps were born out of my dependence on the 501 Spanish Verbs mega book, which all serious Spanish students used to cart around as a necessary tool to look up tenses and verbs when you needed them. I imagine students use their phones and computers to look up verbs as needed these days, rather than the book method! But I used to think it would sure be handy to have a shorter audio version to help you train yourself with verbs. Penton Overseas liked the idea, and I developed another version for bookstores called 101 Spanish Verbs, and I retained the rights to the written book, which I offer as an ebook app as well.

When trying to learn Italian years ago I remember reciting verb tenses as I tried to sleep while staying in Lake Como! While you really only begin to get a firm grasp on verb tenses by repeated usage, they are one of those things a bit like multiplication tables, where boring old rote memorization can play a helpful role. Pains me to say that, as I try to stress non rote forms of learning whenever possible for my kids! But verb tense learning can be tedious, and spending time learning the patterns and going through the regular and irregular verb examples can definitely help you to use these verbs later in conversation.
